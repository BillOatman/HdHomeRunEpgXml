# HdHomeRunEpgXml #
# This program is provided with no warrenty and is for educational purposes only. #

This program downloads the programming for your connected HdHomeRun devices and converts it to a TVXML file which you can then use on Plex or any other Media Center.  To recieve more than 4 hours of programming you must subscribe to SiliconDust's DVR service which provides the extended EPG data that this program uses.

By default, the program will download **Two Weeks** of programming.

**For Windows**
  To run the program on windows, either download and compile the program (Requires Visual Studio 2017 or greater) or download the Release.Zip file in the project.
  
**For Linux/Others**
  The file HdHomeRun.py is a python 3.7 program which is a translation of the C# program.  This python program requires Pip to be installed as well as the urllib3 library.

**Note:**  It is recommended that you schedule the download of the EPG only ONCE per day, plex will read the TVXML file during maintenance in the middle of the night.  On Linux, use crontab -e to schedule, and for windows use the System Task Scheduler.

## Running with Docker

This repository includes a Dockerfile that will build an Alpine Linux Docker image that includes all the dependencies to run the `hdhomerun.py` script to generate the hdhomerun.xml file.

Steps to use:

* Make sure you have docker installed and available in your `$PATH`.
* Download the `Dockerfile` file in the ./Docker to an empty directory.
* Change into the new directory with the Dockerfile in it.
* Run `docker build -t hdhomerunepgxml .` (don't miss the ".")
* Run `docker run --rm hdhomerunepgxml > /[directory]/hdhomerun.xml` where [directory] is the place you want the file stored.
You can schedule the docker run command above as a cronjob.
